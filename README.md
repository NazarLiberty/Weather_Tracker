## What is Weather Tracker?

Weather Tracker is the weather react web application that works for you. From the daily forecast to minute-by-minute updates to radar maps, youâ€™ll be prepared come rain or shine.

This application uses API from [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/api) in conjunction with Google Places API and Google autocomplete. Based on this, the Weather Tracker can autocomplete your city to find, get the coordinates data by Google Places API, and immediately set them to openweathermap API, so the application will know what exactly to show you!

Weather Tracker based on functional components with hooks.
